# The snitch to be delegated by the DseDelegateSnitch
# Out of the box, Cassandra provides:
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.PropertyFileSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackInferringSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.Ec2Snitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.Ec2MultiRegionSnitch
# Full descriptions found at cassandra.yaml:endpoint_snitch.
# DataStax Enterprise provides:
#  - com.datastax.bdp.snitch.DseSimpleSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by DSE workload, which places Cassandra,
#    Analytics, and Solr nodes into their seperate datacenters.

# Kerberos options
#
# The qop is the "Quality of Protection" for each connection.  Used by clients
# and servers.  Below is a list of valid values and their meanings.
#   auth - (default) authentication only
#   auth-int - authentication plus integity protection of all transmitted data
#   auth-conf - authetication plus integrity protection and encryption of all
#              transmitted data
# Warning: Encryption using auth-conf is separate and completely independent
# of whether encryption is done using SSL.  So that if auth-conf is selected
# here and SSL is enabled, then the transmitted data will be encrypted twice.
kerberos_options:
    keytab: resources/dse/conf/dse.keytab
    service_principal: dse/_HOST@REALM
    http_principal: HTTP/_HOST@REALM
    qop: auth

# To ensure that data with a TTL is purged from Solr indexes when it expires,
# DSE periodically checks indexes for data that has exceeded its TTL. These settings
# control the scheduling & execution of those checks.
ttl_index_rebuild_options:
    # by default, schedule a check every 300 seconds
    fixed_rate_period: 300
    # the first check is delayed to speed up startup time
    initial_delay: 20
    # documents subject to TTL are checked in batches: this configures the max number of docs
    # checked per batch

# Solr shard transport options, for inter-node communication between Solr nodes.
shard_transport_options:
#
# Default type is "http" for plain old Solr communication via the standard
# HTTP-based interface.
# The other type is "netty" for TCP-based communication, providing lower latency,
# improved throughput and reduced resource consumption.
    type: http
# Options specific to the "netty" transport type.
# The TCP listen port, mandatory if you either want to use the "netty" transport
# type, or want to later migrate to it from the "http" one. If you plan to use
# and stay with the "http" one, either comment it out or set it to -1.
    netty_server_port: 8984
# The number of server acceptor threads (default is number of available processors).
#   netty_server_acceptor_threads:
# The number of server worker threads (default is number of available processors * 8).
#   netty_server_worker_threads:
# The number of client worker threads (default is number of available processors * 8).
#   netty_client_worker_threads:
# The max number of client connections (default is 100).
#   netty_client_max_connections:
# The client request timeout, in milliseconds (default is 60000).
#   netty_client_request_timeout:

# Solr indexing settings
#
# Max number of concurrent asynchronous indexing threads per Solr core.
# Default is "number of available processors" * 2; if set at 1,
# the system reverts to the synchronous behavior, where data is
# synchronously written into Cassandra and indexed by Solr.
#
# max_solr_concurrency_per_core: 2
#
# The back pressure threshold is the total number of queued asynchronous
# indexing requests per core, computed at Solr commit time;
# when exceeded, back pressure kicks in to avoid excessive
# resources consumption, causing throttling of new incoming requests.
# Default is 500.
#
# back_pressure_threshold_per_core: 500
#
# The max time to wait for flushing of async index updates, happening either
# at Solr commit time or Cassandra flush time.
# Flushing should always complete successfully, in order to fully sync Solr indexes
# with Cassandra data, so should always be set at a reasonable high value,
# expressed in minutes.
# Default is 5.

# flush_max_time_per_core: 5

# Disk health check settings
#
# Minimum disk space in MB allowed on a partition holding a data directory
# before a node is shut down.
#
# min_disk_space_before_failure: 10
#
# Time interval in minutes that the disk health checker will leave between
# each check. If this setting is set to 0 the disk health checker will be
# disabled.
