# The snitch to be delegated by the DseDelegateSnitch
# Out of the box, Cassandra provides:
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.PropertyFileSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.GossipingPropertyFileSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.RackInferringSnitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.Ec2Snitch
#  - org.apache.cassandra.locator.Ec2MultiRegionSnitch
# Full descriptions found at cassandra.yaml:endpoint_snitch.
# DataStax Enterprise provides:
#  - com.datastax.bdp.snitch.DseSimpleSnitch:
#    Proximity is determined by DSE workload, which places Cassandra,
#    Analytics, and Solr nodes into their seperate datacenters.

# Kerberos options
#
# The qop is the "Quality of Protection" for each connection.  Used by clients
# and servers.  Below is a list of valid values and their meanings.
#   auth - (default) authentication only
#   auth-int - authentication plus integity protection of all transmitted data
#   auth-conf - authetication plus integrity protection and encryption of all
#              transmitted data
# Warning: Encryption using auth-conf is separate and completely independent
# of whether encryption is done using SSL.  So that if auth-conf is selected
# here and SSL is enabled, then the transmitted data will be encrypted twice.
kerberos_options:
    keytab: resources/dse/conf/dse.keytab
    service_principal: dse/_HOST@REALM
    http_principal: HTTP/_HOST@REALM
    qop: auth

# To ensure that data with a TTL is purged from Solr indexes when it expires,
# DSE periodically checks indexes for data that has exceeded its TTL. These settings
# control the scheduling & execution of those checks.
ttl_index_rebuild_options:
    # by default, schedule a check every 300 seconds
    fixed_rate_period: 300
    # the first check is delayed to speed up startup time
    initial_delay: 20
    # documents subject to TTL are checked in batches: this configures the max number of docs
    # checked per batch
    max_docs_per_batch: 200

# Solr concurrency settings
#
# Max number of concurrent asynchronous indexing threads per core.
# Default is "number of available cores" * 2; if set at 1,
# the system reverts to the synchronous behavior, where data is
# synchronously written into Cassandra and indexed by Solr.
#
# max_solr_concurrency_per_core: 2
#
# The back pressure threshold is the max number of queued asynchronous
# indexing requests per core, computed at Solr commit time;
# when exceeded, back pressure kicks in to avoid excessive
# resources consumption, causing throttling of new incoming requests.
# Default is 10000.
#
# back_pressure_threshold_per_core: 10000
